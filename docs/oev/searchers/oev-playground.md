# OEV Playground

For the previous OEV version we had developed an OEV playground that explained
the auction process through an interactive UI. While this provided a great intro
to the auction process, it only scratched the surface of OEV. To provide a full
playground for OEV liquidations, we've decided to launch our own dApp built with
API3 OEV proxies. This allows us to build a fully functional OEV bot and share
that as a reference.

## The dApp

::: warning

The dApp is using real assets to allow for a more realistic experience. The dApp
is meant to serve as a playground for OEV bots. If you're just looking to
borrow/lend assets, use the real Compound dApp or other platform instead.

:::

The dApp is a Compound3 fork launched on a Base network with real assets,
serving as an OEV playground. The dApp offers a very basic UI for borrowing and
lending assets. It mirrors the
[real USDC Comet on Base](https://app.compound.finance/markets/usdc-basemainnet)
and allows for borrowing USDC by supplying and of the ETH, cbETH, wstETH as
collateral.

Refer to this table for dApp's details:
