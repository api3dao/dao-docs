# MEV with Signed APIs

One step closer to OEV searching, is to extend MEV bots to utilize the public
[Base Feed Endpoints](/oev/overview/target-chain.md#base-feed-endpoints). These
endpoints are public, and also used by API3 DAO push oracle - so there is tight
competition - something which searchers are already used to.

The existing MEV bot can utilize this off-chain open source data and make a base
feed update on-chain whenever there is OEV to be captured. Refer to
[dAPIs Reference](/dapis/reference/understand/#dapis) for more details.

One advantage of using this data is that searchers can easily simulate the data
feed update (which is permissionless for base feeds) and to more easily
determine the liquidation opportunities. This is a direct improvement over
monitoring data source values and predicting the next oracle update.

This solution is also a perfect backup in case OEV is down or in maintenance,
because dAPIs are decentralized with great uptime.

## Simulating a Data Feed Update

Assuming a searcher calls the Signed APIs and has a valid data to update the
base feed, they can use them to simulate the data feed update on-chain followed
up by a call to check for liquidation opportunities.

The code below demonstrates how this process can be implemented in JavaScript.
Note that this code makes use of variables which are not defined in the code
snippet. Their purpose can be understood from the context and is left out to
keep the example concise and focused on how a dAPI can be updated.

```javascript
const beaconsIds = []; // Assume the data feed is a beacon set with these beacons
const dataFeedSignedData = []; // Assume we have some signed data to update

// 1. Create the calldata for updating the base feed beacons
const dataFeedUpdateCalldata = dataFeedSignedData.map((signedData) => ({
  target: api3ServerAddress,
  allowFailure: true,
  callData: api3ServerV1.interface.encodeFunctionData(
    'updateBeaconWithSignedData',
    [airnode, templateId, timestamp, encodedValue, signature]
  ),
}));
dataFeedUpdateCalldata.push({
  target: api3ServerAddress,
  allowFailure: true,
  callData: api3ServerV1.interface.encodeFunctionData(
    'updateBeaconSetWithBeacons',
    [beaconsIds.map((beaconsId) => beaconId)]
  ),
});

// 2. Create calldata to simulate liquidation opportunity
const liquidationOpportunityCalldata = {
  target: liquidatorContract,
  callData: liquidatorContract.interface.encodeFunctionData('liquidate', [
    borrower,
  ]),
  allowFailure: false,
};

// 3. Merge the calldata for updating the feeds and capturing the liquidation
const calldata = [...dataFeedUpdateCalldata, liquidationOpportunityCalldata];

// 4. Execute the staticcall multicall
const result = await multicall3.aggregate3.staticCall(calls);
```

## Capture MEV

If a searcher successfully simulated a profitable MEV opportunity, they can use
the same data feed calldata, and submit the transaction instead of simulating
it.
