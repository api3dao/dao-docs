# Governance

The DAO votes on high-level matters such as staking incentives and
collateralization (parameters of the DAO smart contract itself), as well as
grant proposals that directly transfer DAO treasury assets to contributors of
Api3.

The Api3 ecosystem is a single token environment, using its native token (API3).
Check out the Medium post
[API3 Tokenomics Update](https://medium.com/api3/api3-tokenomics-update-f032d6e49b30)
for an in-depth overview on API3 tokenomics. To participate in governance, you
need to stake API3 tokens in the DAO’s staking pool.
