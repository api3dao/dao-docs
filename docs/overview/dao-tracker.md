# DAO Tracker

The [DAO Tracker](https://tracker.api3.org/) is a community-developed tool that
provides additional insight into the DAObeyond what is offered by the
intentionally minimalist DAO Dashboard. It features data about all aspects of
the DAO, including staking and reward data, members, proposals, and the API3 DAO
treasury.

Its [open source codebase](https://github.com/api3dao/api3-tracker) was
developed by GitHub user EnormousCloud.
