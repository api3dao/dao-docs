# DAO Tracker

The [DAO Tracker](https://tracker.api3.org/) is a community-developed tool that
provides additional insight into the DAO beyond what is offered by the
intentionally minimalist DAO Dashboard. The DAO Tracker covers staking and
rewards, member wallets, proposals, and the Api3 DAO treasury.

Its [open source codebase](https://github.com/api3dao/api3-tracker) was
initially developed by GitHub user EnormousCloud and is now maintained by the
Api3 team.
