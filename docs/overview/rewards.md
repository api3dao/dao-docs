# Rewards

Through staking API3 tokens in the pool, you gain access to weekly rewards (unlocked
after one year) and are also granted voting rights on active DAO proposals and
rewards.

Why one year? Since rewards get minted every week, you can think of this as a
rolling unlock (the rewards you receive this week will get unlocked 1 year
later, the rewards you will receive next week will get unlocked 1 year 1 week
later, etc.) This 1 year-lock is the secret sauce to good decentralized
governance, it essentially aligns the incentives of the stakers/governors with
the ones of the DAO/project/token for a whole year.
