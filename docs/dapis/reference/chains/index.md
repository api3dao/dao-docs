# Chains and Contracts

dAPIs can be read on the following chains using
[proxy contracts](/dapis/reference/understand/proxy-contracts.md) via the
[IProxy](/dapis/reference/understand/proxy-contracts.md#iproxy-interface-contracts)
interface. Use the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org/) website to acquire
