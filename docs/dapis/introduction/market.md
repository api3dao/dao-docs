# API3 Market

API3 has developed an oracle solution that simplifies how smart contracts can
interact with real-world data. As such we believe it is equally as important the
process of accessing a data feed is as user-friendly, efficient and
permissionless.

### What is the API3 Market?

The API3 Market provides tooling for dApp owners to access decentralized price
feeds, known as dAPIs. Use the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org) to search
for dAPIs, activate feeds, obtain dAPI proxy contract addresses, and monitor
dAPIs.

From the API3 Market developers will manage all data feed subscriptions. Once
the dAPI interface has been imported to a dApps contract, upgrading a data feed
happens through the API3 Market.

### Activating a dAPI Price Feed

The API3 Market is optimized to simplify how developers active price oracles.
You follow these simple steps:

1- Head to the required chain 2- Within the chain section, search for your
required data feed 3- Select your oracle specification 4- Add to order and pay
for gas

These steps are expanded on within the dAPI getting started materials.

::: info API3 Market provides a permissionless price oracle

Users of dAPIs can independently activate and read an decentralized price oracle
through the API3 Market.
