Use the script `/libs/link-validator.js` to validate links with or without
attached anchors. The link validator is a manual process that should be
performed as often as possible.

The script is part of a three step process to keep the links in the docs clean.

The three steps:

1. `pnpm docs:build`: When doing a local build VitePress will valid markdown
   links and does so very well. Fix them before proceeding. This step will also
   catch bad `src` paths for images. It does not validate anchors.
2. Search the code base for `](#`. This will show markdown links that link
   directly to an anchor. While this will work, the anchors cannot be validated
   by `/libs/link-validator.js`, see [Hyperlinks](/dev/hyperlinks.md) to
   understand how to fix them.
3. Run the `/libs/link-validator.js` script.

## Using the script

The script must be run locally and will not work as a GitHub action.

### 1. Build the docs

Build the docs as usual using the standard build command provided by VitePress.

```sh
pnpm docs:build
```

Note that the build script may in fact catch bad links in of itself. Any
reported links should be fixed before proceeding.

### 2. Start the local VitePress server

VitePress has a built-in http server that publishes the files from the `/dist`
folder.

```sh
pnpm docs:serve
```

### 3. Run the script

Open a new terminal window to run the script. The script's output will display
an indicator for failures as it steps through each file. There will be a summary
of all link failures at the end of the script output.

You can run the Link Validator against the entire `/dist` folder which will
validate all docsets but this can be time consuming. Narrowing the scope of the
validation to a particular folder (docset) can hasten the validation process. Be
sure to use the correct port displayed by VitePress server.

```sh
node ./libs/link-validator.js  http://localhost:8082  ./docs/.vitepress/dist/
```
