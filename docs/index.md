# What is the API3 DAO?

API3 delegates much of its governance to the vote of a Decentralized Autonomous
Organization (DAO). API3 is a collaborative effort to build, manage and monetize
data feeds at scale. To achieve delegated governance and distribute grants in a
fully decentralized way, the incentives and processes of the participants are
reconciled through the governance, security, and value capture utilities of the
API3 token and its powers in the API3 DAO.
