# Voting

Staking grants DAO members the ability to vote on proposals. Your voting power
is calculated by the number of tokens you have staked divided by the total
number of tokens staked at the time the proposal was made. To Vote, select a
proposal on the Governance page and click Vote to cast a vote “For” or
“Against”.

If you do not want to vote on each proposal yourself, you can delegate your
votes to another wallet. To delegate your votes, navigate to the Governance page
and click “Delegate”. Enter the address of the wallet you wish to delegate your
votes to or the ENS name associated with it, and finalize the transaction.

When you delegate your vote to another user, only that person can vote for you.
However, if the person you delegated to has also delegated to someone, your
voting power is discarded. You can update your delegator after seven days have
passed since your last delegation.
