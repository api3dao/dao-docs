# Using the DAO Dashboard

The [DAO Dashboard](https://dao.api3.org/) is the portal to participate in the
Api3 DAO. It is aimed at Api3 members and others that want to interact with the
DAO or modify/reuse any of its infrastructure. The DAO requires a web3 wallet,
such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/), to be integrated with your
browser. Be sure your wallet is connected to the Ethereum mainnet.
